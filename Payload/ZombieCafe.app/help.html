			<h3>Caf&#233; Menu</h3>
			These are the buttons on the left side of the main caf&#233; screen (top left on iPad).
			<ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li>Tap the Zombie Caf&#233; logo to return to the Main Menu.</li>
				<li>Tap the shopping bag icon to open the store. </li>
				<li>Tap the map icon to view your neighborhood map, where you can raid other caf&#233;s and visit friends. (Or raid your friends' caf&#233;s!)</li>
				<li>Tap the clipboard icon to view pending or completed orders and attacks your friends have made and to see a tally of your successful attacks and defenses.</li>
				<li>Tap the book icon to view your recipe book and browse your unlocked recipes. The left/right arrows will flip between recipes, and the up/down arrows will show rare/special versions of recipes. Touching a recipe will set it on an open stove to cook, but you will still need to select a worker to tell them to cook it.</li>
				<li>Tap the zombie icon to view bios of your current staff (and optionally fire them to make room). The number underneath this icon represents how many employees you have, out of your current limit.</li>
			</ul>
			When these areas have something new that's of interest, there will be a bouncing exclamation mark above them.
		</li>
		<a name="awning"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Caf&#233; Awning</h3>
			This is the information displayed at the top of the main caf&#233; screen.
			<ul style="list-style: disc;">
				<li>Under "Your Caf&#233;" is your caf&#233;'s star rating. Your rating indicates your caf&#233;'s current popularity, and will go up or down depending on the consistency of your service, and what items you have in your caf&#233;. Keep serving food to get a higher rating and more customers.  More customers means more money!</li>
				<li>To the right of "Your Caf&#233;" is your caf&#233;'s level number and XP (experience) progress bar. Keep cooking and raiding to gain XP - with every level you unlock new recipes, competitors, zombies, and new items in the store!</li>
				<li>To the right of the XP bar are your current supplies of cash and Toxin. Get more cash by serving and raiding.  Get more Toxin by coming back every day to cook, winning raids, or by purchasing it.</li>
				<li>In the top right is the Get More Toxin button. You can use your iTunes account to buy Toxin.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>Touch the door at any time to close the caf&#233;. Your star rating will slowly drop while it is closed.
		</li>
<a name="avatars"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Chef Avatar</h3>
			If you decide you want to change your chef avatar, select your chef and then press the "chef" button to view all of the available avatars. (This list will be updated periodically.) Zombie chefs will have a higher energy/defense when your friends raid your caf&#233;, making it harder for them to win. These are roughly equivalent to the strength that each of these zombie types would have as an employee. An exclamation point will appear over the chef button when new avatars are available. Defeating special enemy caf&#233;s will unlock additional avatars.
		</li>

		<a name="cooking"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Cooking</h3>
			Select a stove to bring up the
			recipe book and choose a recipe. Cooking and serving can be done by
			both the chef (your avatar) and any of your undead employees. Select
			a character and then select the stove you would like them to cook
			on. Touch the stove when a dish is on it to view remaining cooking time or time remaining before the dish spoils.<br />
			<br />
			When your dish is finished cooking, bring it to the serving counter
			by touching your chef or a zombie, and then touching the stove with the
			dish.  If you don't serve a dish, it will eventually burn on the stove.
			<br /><br />
			Zombies can cook, but will slowly use up their energy while cooking.
			A cooking dish needs to be attended to by a zombie or your chef for as long as it takes to finish.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Always make sure you have something cooking to ensure you have enough food to serve.  Cooking is also the best way to gain XP and level up your caf&#233;.
		</li>

		<a name="recipes"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Recipes</h3>
			There are two ways you can start cooking a recipe in the game: through the Main Recipe Cookbook 
			at the top of the screen or by tapping the stoves that you own in the game. 
			The Main Recipe Cookbook will divide the recipes into 4 sections:
			<br />
			<br />
			<ol>
				<li><b>General Cookbook</b> - Displays the recipes you earn by leveling up.</li>
				<li><b>Raid Cookbook</b> - Displays recipes that can only be collected by raiding enemy caf&#233;s, receiving them from friends or paying Toxin.</li>
				<li><b>Theme Cookbooks</b> - Display recipes based on popular themes. Information on unlocking each theme can be found in each specific Themed Cookbook. Some of these cookbooks are unlocked by buying special stoves, while others are unlocked by paying cash.</li>
				<li><b>Favorites Cookbook</b> - Displays recipes you've marked as favorites. You can mark or unmark a recipe as a favorite with the star button on that specific recipe.</li>
			</ol>
			<br />
			<h4>Variants</h4>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Spicy</b> - Earns higher XP.</li>
			<li><b>Very Spicy</b> - Earns higher XP.</li>
			<li><b>Fancy</b> - Costs more to cook, but earns more money.</li>
			<li><b>Very Fancy</b> - Costs more to cook, but earns more money.</li>
			<li><b>Bulk</b> - Produces more servings.</li>
			<li><b>Fresh</b> - Takes longer to burn.</li>
			<li><b>Frozen</b> - Costs less but takes longer to cook.</li>
			<li><b>Quick</b> - Takes less time to cook.</li>
			<li><b>Very Quick</b> - Takes less time to cook.</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Stealing food during raids and ordering from friends can unlock rare/special versions of recipes that are often more valuable than their normal counterparts. Each of these special versions have different bonuses, but it's not always obvious. If you have
			a dish in your fridge that has an UNLOCK button, it means you don't have that recipe - it's wise to UNLOCK it rather than serve it. Unlocking many recipes can also earn you XP bonuses.
		</li>

		<a name="serving"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Serving</h3>
			Select a zombie (or your chef) and touch a serving counter or table to have them serve customers.
			While they're serving, workers will automatically take dishes to waiting customers and clear dirty dishes.
			<br /><br />
			You don't need to tell servers what to do, but you need to make sure they've got a clear path to every table, serving counter, and sink.
			If a server can't reach a table they won't serve customers who sit there.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Like cooking, zombies use energy to serve. However, the more servers you have the less work it is for each of them - you'll serve customers faster and use less energy.
		</li>

		<a name="customers"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Customers</h3>
			Customers will visit your caf&#233; looking for a meal.  If they leave happy, they'll give you money and improve your star rating (leading to more customers).
			If they can't find a clean table to sit at, or wait too long to be served, they'll leave unhappy - lowering your rating.
			<br /><br />
			Selecting a customer will show you their name. If you have room for another zombie, you can touch the INFECT button to turn them into a zombie.
			The type of customer you choose to infect will affect how good they are at working in the caf&#233;. (If you need to make room, store a zombie in the Meat Locker, if it is unlocked)
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Watch customers (and touch the INFO button to see their bio) to get
			clues as to their individual strengths and weaknesses. As your caf&#233; advances different customers will arrive - keep your eyes peeled! Check out the Zombiepedia for even more information on the various zombie types.
		</li>

		<a name="zombies"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Zombies</h3>
			Selecting a zombie will show you their name, energy bar, and
			their current status (cooking, serving, resting, etc.) If your
			zombie's energy is low, you can press the REST button to give them
			a break while their energy recovers. You can also revitalize them
			instantly by pressing ENERGIZE to spend a vial of toxin. If you have the Meat Locker unlocked you can tap the "MEATLOCKER" button to store them.
			<br /><br />
			While they're selected, touching a stove, table, serving counter or the work button will
			immediately put them back to work.  Selecting the INFO button will
			bring up your zombie's bio and allow you to fire them. Zombies will
			gain experience by serving and raiding friends and enemies. When a
			zombie levels up, its maximum energy will increase. Zombies will
			not always stay on task or prioritize - sometimes they'll daydream
			or fall asleep! So be prepared to remind them once in a while what
			they should be doing. Tired zombies (zombies with low energy) are
			more likely to make mistakes or try to eat the customers.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Try your zombies in different roles to see what works best.
			Some zombies have more energy, some are stronger, some are faster, some get more tips,
			some are better at staying on task and not attacking your customers.
		</li>
		<a name="Tombstones"></a>
		<li>
		<h3>Tombstones</h3>
				Tombstones are used to give your zombie horde special bonuses, when placed outside your caf&#233;.
			<br /><br />
			During a raid, touch a tombstone icon to give all of your zombies that bonus for five seconds. Only one type of bonus can be used at a time, and while that bonus is in effect, the zombies will glow the color of the tombstone. The Strength and Health Tombstones can be used a maximum of 5 times (upgradeable to 12) at a time, and will automatically regenerate back to maximum usage the next day. 
		</li>
		<a name="customization"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>The Store</h3>
			Select the shopping bag icon in the top left corner of the caf&#233;
			screen to view store items. Scroll up or down, or tap the red
			arrows, to view items. Select an item to place it in your caf&#233;, and press purchase to buy it.
			You can touch and hold items in your caf&#233; to move them later. Tap the $ button when they are selected to sell them. 
			<br /><br />
			Some of the items will be locked until your caf&#233; is a higher level.
			<br /><br />
			<ul style="list-style: disc;">
			<li>
			<strong>Cash Items</strong><br />
			Items with dollar sign symbols will accumulate cash on their own.
			A dollar sign or an exclamation point will appear above an item when it has cash available, and tapping it will add some cash to your total.
			Items with an exclamation point are full and cannot accumulate any more cash until they've been emptied.
			<br /><br />
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Popularity Items</strong><br />
			Items with star symbols will help your star rating increase faster and decrease slower. Like cash items, the more stars, the better.
			<br /><br />
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Toxin Barrels</strong><br />
			Toxin barrels help your zombies regain energy faster.  You can have more than one barrel to increase the effect.
			<br /><br />
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Caf&#233; Expansions</strong><br />
			Besides items, you can also buy expansions to your caf&#233;.  Adding more room gives you more room
			to serve and customize.  Bigger caf&#233;s can make more money, and faster.
			<br /><br />
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Special Stoves</strong><br />
			Certain stoves in the store menu will unlock additional recipe books when purchased, and come with two recipes. They can also be upgraded to unlock even more recipes in that recipe book.
			<br /><br />
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Pets</strong><br />
			Pets are like zombies, but do not serve food. Each pet house/station offers a bonus for your caf&#233;, and pets can also be sent on raids alongside your other zombies. If you collect one of each robo pet, during raids you can form a super robot called Amptron.
			<br /><br />
			</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<a name="customization2"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>Item Storage</h3>
			Select the box icon on the caf&#233;
			screen to open up the storage tab of the store menu. Scroll up or down, or tap the red
			arrows, to view items. Select an item and press place to put it back in your caf&#233;.
			You can touch and hold items in your caf&#233; and tap the box icon to store them again.
			<br /><br />			
			</ul>
		</li>
		
		<a name="multiplayer"></a>
		<li>
			<h3>The Map</h3>
			Scroll left on the map screen to see your friends, and scroll right to see enemy caf&#233;s.<br />
			<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
			<a name="friends"></a><br />
			<li>
			<strong>Friends/Franchises</strong><br />
			You can invite friends to open a franchise by logging
			into your Facebook account through the Main Menu, or by
			selecting "Invite Friends" from the far left of the map screen.
			While in another player's caf&#233;, you can collect franchise fees,
			or order food from them by touching their menu book. You can only order one dish from each friend per day. <br />
			<br><b>Orders: </b>When called upon to cook a dish for a friend, your order chit/clipboard on the left of the screen will have a bouncing "!". Tapping the chit will give you
			the option of filling, or rejecting the order. While visiting a friend's caf&#233;, you can touch the fridge icon to deliver the order (or give them other extra food you might have in your fridge).  The order board will act as a hub allowing you to manage your orders.  The "Pending" tab shows orders that you have not started cooking, "In-Progress will" show orders that currently occupy stove space and the "Deliver" tab will show orders that are ready to be sent (you can deliver completed dishes directly from this menu). While in your own caf&#233;, cooked orders will appear in your fridge with the name of the intended recipient. If you can't deliver the dish or decide you just want it for yourself, you can use the "serve" button to serve it in your caf&#233;. After delivering the dish, the money will immediately be added to your total.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Ordering food from friends is a great way of unlocking valuable and rare recipes you don't yet have.  Filling orders is a great way to get quick cash and share recipes with friends.
			<br />
			If yours or your friends' caf&#233;s appear greenish on the map, it means they're under investigation by the Zombie Labor Union. You won't be able to visit them until the investigation is complete.
			<br />
			</li>
			<a name="raids"></a><br />
			<li>
			<strong>Enemy Caf&#233;s/Raids</strong><br />
			After selecting a caf&#233; to raid, touch each zombie
			and then the ATTACK button if you want them to go on a
			general rampage. If you want them to attack a specific
			person, or steal food, tap the zombie and then your
			target. Tap the retreat button (the white flag in the top right) to have your zombies retreat.
			<br /><br />
			If you defeat an enemy caf&#233;, it will be forced to close, but a new restaurant will open in its place after a while. If an enemy caf&#233; is allowed to operate in your area for too long, it will start to steal your customers!</dd>
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Raiding enemy caf&#233;s is another great way to get valuable and rare recipes.  You also have a chance of winning Toxin!
			<br /><br />
			</li>
			<a name="bossfight"></a>
			<li>
			<strong>Boss Fights</strong><br />
			After level five, an extra enemy caf&#233; will occasionally appear on the map screen. Defeating this special chef will result in a rare recipe and a new avatar available. The chances of seeing his caf&#233; will increase with every level, and levels 24 to 26 he'll appear as a regular enemy.
			<br /><br />
			</li>
			<a name="friendraids"></a>
			<li>
			<strong>Raiding Friends</strong><br />
			You can also raid your friends' caf&#233;s by visiting them and selecting "attack". Your zombies run the same risks, but your friend will not lose anything, even if you are successful. You can only raid a friend once per day. A bouncing "!" on your clipboard indicates that you've been raided. Touch it to view the results of the raid.
			<br /><br />
			</li>
			<a name="leaderboards"></a>
			<li>
			<strong>Leaderboards</strong><br />
			Sign in with an <i>Apple Game Center</i> account and see where you stand on the global leaderboard; compare your scores against the top players and your friends.  You also have the ability to invite people that are within your score bracket to be your friends.  This will allow you to work with and compete against them.  Leaderboards score players based on the total number of recipes that they have delivered to friends in the last seven days.  Since it is a rolling leaderboard the more you play the greater the chance you have of getting to the top of the list.  (Note: your score may not appear immediately on the leaderboards)

				<li>First Purple Star - 48 hours to expire.</li>
				<li>Second Purple Star - Adds 36 hours to the time remaining before losing a purple star.</li>
				<li>Third Purple Star  - Adds 24 hours to the time remaining before losing a purple star.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
				To maintain three purple stars, continue completing objectives within 24 hours. Each additional objective will earn you an additional 24 hours before your purple stars expire, up to a maximum of one week (168 hours).

		<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
		<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
			<a name="Q12"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>How do I restore my game data if I've switched to a new device?</dt>
			<dd>
				After freshly installing the game, opening the app while logged into the same Game Center account should prompt a message on the cafe screen (AFTER choosing an avatar) asking if you would like to restore your save. Please note: this may not work if you have restarted the game by deleting your game data via the settings menu.
			</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q1"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>How do I add people to my friends list?</dt>
			<dd>
				Any friends you have on Facebook or GameCenter that have the application will be automatically added. You can manage your list of friends by selecting "Friends" 	from the Main Menu. You can also tap the "Invite Friends" button from the Map screen, the Friends screen (from the Main Menu) or tap the "Invite" button on the leaderboard, next to players within your score bracket.
			</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q2"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>Will my caf&#233; earn money while the app is closed?</dt>
			<dd>Your caf&#233; should earn money, even when the application is closed (it might just take a little longer). Be careful not to run out of food!</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q3"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>How do I move my furniture/appliances/etc?</dt>
			<dd>Press and hold the item until it is highlighted green, then drag it where you want it to be. Press the arrow to change the orientation of the item. You can also store or sell items while they are selected.</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q4"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>What happens if all of my food gets piled on one serving counter?</dt>
			<dd>Don't worry! You'll still have the same number of portions (dishes do not overwrite each other); you just won't be able to see all of the dishes at the same time. This may bend the limits of space, and physical reality, but at least you can use one serving counter.</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q5"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>How long does it take food to burn?</dt>
			<dd>Your dishes will burn if left untouched for a time corresponding to the cooking time:</dd>
			<ul>
			<li><b>5 min. or less</b> = Burn time is 5x the cooking time. </li>
			<li><b>6 to 30 min.</b> = Burn time is 4x the cooking time.</li>
			<li><b>31+ min.</b> = Burn time is 3x the cooking time. </li>
			Note: An extra multiplier is added on top for the "Fresh" variant of every recipe.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<p>
			<a name="Q6"></a>
			<li>
			<dt>What items earn extra cash?</dt>
			<dd>Items like the ATM or the arcade machine that appear with a dollar sign above them in the store will accumulate money over time. When an exclamation point appears above them, they've reached their maximum capacity and need to be emptied.</dd>
			</li>
			<a name="Q7"></a>
